# Flipping Out

This repository is for the Flipping Out assignment from The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

The assignment was to build a program which simulated many coin flips, and to then chart the results over a thousand trials of coin flips. The results are collected in the Jupyter Notebook file (which is not currently complete, and which I intend to go back and fix at some point.)

The purpose of this assignment was to practice building simulations as well as introducing the class to graphing using matplotlib in Python.
